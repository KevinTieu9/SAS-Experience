 75         *    a) Complete the PROC PRINT statement to list the     *;
 76         *       first 20 observations in PG1.NP_SUMMARY.          *;
 77         *    b) Add a VAR statement to include only the following *;
 78         *       variables: Reg, Type, ParkName, DayVisits,        *;
 79         *       TentCampers, and RVCampers. Highlight the step    *;
 80         *       and run the selected code.                        *;
 81         *       Do you observe any possible inconsistencies in    *;
 82         *       the data?                                         *;
 83         *    c) Copy the PROC PRINT step and paste it at the end  *;
 84         *       of the program. Change PRINT to MEANS and remove  *;
 85         *       the OBS= data set option. Modify the VAR          *;
 86         *       statement to calculate summary statistics for     *;
 87         *       DayVisits, TentCampers, and RVCampers. Highlight  *;
 88         *       the step and run the selected code.               *;
 89         *       What is the minimum value for tent campers? Is    *;
 90         *       that value unexpected?                            *;
 91         *    d) Copy the PROC MEANS step and paste it at the end  *;
 92         *       of the program. Change MEANS to UNIVARIATE.       *;
 93         *       Highlight the step and run the selected code.     *;
 94         *       Are there negative values for any of the columns? *;
 95         *    e) Copy the PROC UNIVARIATE step and paste it at the *;
 96         *       end of the program. Change UNIVARIATE to FREQ.    *;
 97         *       Change the VAR statement to a TABLES statement to *;
 98         *       produce frequency tables for Reg and Type.        *;
 99         *       Highlight the step and run the selected code.     *;
 100        *       Are there any lowercase codes? Are there any      *;
 101        *       codes that occur only once in the table?          *;
 102        *    f) Add comments before each step to document the     *;
 103        *       program. Save the program as np_validate.sas in   *;
 104        *       the output folder.                                *;
